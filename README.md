  <summary>Python Usage</summary>

Install: `pip install nlprule`

Use:
```python
from nlprule import Tokenizer, Rules

tokenizer = Tokenizer.load("en")
rules = Rules.load("en", tokenizer)
```
```python
rules.correct("He wants that you send him an email.")
# returns: 'He wants you to send him an email.'

rules.correct("I can due his homework.")
# returns: 'I can do his homework.'

for s in rules.suggest("She was not been here since Monday."):
    print(s.start, s.end, s.replacements, s.source, s.message)
# prints:
# 4 16 ['was not', 'has not been'] WAS_BEEN.1 Did you mean was not or has not been?
```
```python
for sentence in tokenizer.pipe("A brief example is shown."):
    for token in sentence:
        print(
            repr(token.text).ljust(10),
            repr(token.span).ljust(10),
            repr(token.tags).ljust(24),
            repr(token.lemmas).ljust(24),
            repr(token.chunks).ljust(24),
        )
# prints:
# 'A'        (0, 1)     ['DT']                   ['A', 'a']               ['B-NP-singular']       
# 'brief'    (2, 7)     ['JJ']                   ['brief']                ['I-NP-singular']       
# 'example'  (8, 15)    ['NN:UN']                ['example']              ['E-NP-singular']       
# 'is'       (16, 18)   ['VBZ']                  ['be', 'is']             ['B-VP']                
# 'shown'    (19, 24)   ['VBN']                  ['show', 'shown']        ['I-VP']                
# '.'        (24, 25)   ['.', 'PCT', 'SENT_END'] ['.']                    ['O']
```

Recommended setup:

`Cargo.toml`
```toml
[dependencies]
nlprule = "<version>"

[build-dependencies]
nlprule-build = "<version>" # must be the same as the nlprule version!
```

`build.rs`
```rust
fn main() -> Result<(), nlprule_build::Error> {
    println!("cargo:rerun-if-changed=build.rs");

    nlprule_build::BinaryBuilder::new(
        &["en"],
        std::env::var("OUT_DIR").expect("OUT_DIR is set when build.rs is running"),
    )
    .build()?
    .validate()
}
```

`src/main.rs`
```rust
use nlprule::{Rules, Tokenizer, tokenizer_filename, rules_filename};

fn main() {
    let mut tokenizer_bytes: &'static [u8] = include_bytes!(concat!(
        env!("OUT_DIR"),
        "/",
        tokenizer_filename!("en")
    ));
    let mut rules_bytes: &'static [u8] = include_bytes!(concat!(
        env!("OUT_DIR"),
        "/",
        rules_filename!("en")
    ));

    let tokenizer = Tokenizer::from_reader(&mut tokenizer_bytes).expect("tokenizer binary is valid");
    let rules = Rules::from_reader(&mut rules_bytes).expect("rules binary is valid");

    assert_eq!(
        rules.correct("She was not been here since Monday.", &tokenizer),
        String::from("She was not here since Monday.")
    );
}
```

`nlprule` and `nlprule-build` versions are kept in sync.

## Main features

- Rule-based Grammatical Error Correction through multiple thousand rules.
- A text processing pipeline doing sentence segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, lemmatization, chunking and disambiguation.
- Support for **35 languages** built from LanguageTool 6.5 resources (see table below).
- Morphological synthesis: `match` elements with `postag` / `postag_regexp` / `postag_replace`
  inflect lemmas in suggestions, mirroring LanguageTool's `MatchState`.
- Spellchecking. (*in progress*)

## Goals

- A single place to apply spellchecking and grammatical error correction for a downstream task.
- Fast, low-resource NLP suited for running:
    1. as a pre- / postprocessing step for more sophisticated (i. e. ML) approaches.
    2. in the background of another application with low overhead.
    3. client-side in the browser via WebAssembly.
- 100% Rust code and dependencies.

## Comparison to LanguageTool

All languages are built from a LanguageTool 6.5 desktop distribution with
`build/make_build_dirs.py` + `build/make_configs.py`; per-language binaries are compiled with
`scripts/compile_all.sh`. "XML rules" counts `<rule>`/`<rulegroup>` entries in `grammar.xml`
(expanded rules count higher); "passing" counts rules whose embedded LT examples
(`test --rules ...`) pass. Serbian rules are Java classes in LT (no XML to convert);
Japanese/Chinese need LT's specialized tokenizers; `da`/`km`/`crh` suffer from incomplete
tagger dictionaries in the LT distribution itself.

Totals: ~119,000 runnable rules, ~109,400 passing their embedded LanguageTool
examples (~92%). †`nl` includes the 66k-entry `replace.txt` table appended to
the grammar; table rules carry no embedded examples (they pass vacuously —
multi-word table entries can never match a single token under nlprule's
token semantics, so they were neutralized to a shared never-matching pattern
to keep compilation fast; without the table `nl` is 1544 runnable / 1492
passing). Highlights: uk 97.9%, be 98.1%, nl 96.6%, sr 97.8%, de 94.9%,
ja 95.5% (lindera/ipadic), ro 95.6%, ta 100%, ga 92.3%, zh 81.6%, ru 84%,
ar 85.2%, es 78.1%, ca 75.3%.

### Live comparison against the LanguageTool HTTP server

`build/compare_server.py` sends each language's embedded example sentences
(unique, up to 1000 per language) to a local instance of the official
LanguageTool 6.5 HTTP server and to nlprule, and compares the rule IDs that
fire per sentence (standard level, ids normalized to LT's sub-rule ids):

| lang | sentences | only nlprule | only LT | ID precision vs LT | ID recall vs LT | Jaccard |
|------|-----------|--------------|---------|--------------------|----------------|---------|
| de   | 1000      | 11        | 16     | 0.97               | 0.96           | 0.98    |
| uk   | 1000      | 38        | 29     | 0.95               | 0.96           | 0.96    |
| ru   | 1000      | 59        | 64     | 0.93               | 0.92           | 0.94    |
| es   | 1000      | 57        | 71     | 0.92               | 0.90           | 0.93    |
| fr   | 1000      | 58        | 75     | 0.90               | 0.88           | 0.93    |
| pt   | 1000      | 62        | 83     | 0.90               | 0.87           | 0.91    |
| ca   | 1000      | 66         | 91      | 0.89               | 0.85           | 0.90    |
| ar   | 616       | 51           | 63      | 0.87               | 0.84           | 0.89    |
| en   | 1000      | 79         | 96      | 0.88               | 0.86           | 0.90    |
| nl   | 1000      | 147        | 186     | 0.83               | 0.79           | 0.81    |

This includes the Java-only built-in rules that have no XML representation,
ported to Rust (see "ported" below): `UPPERCASE_SENTENCE_START` (with the
Ukrainian list-letter exception, pt dialogue dashes, nl `'k`-contraction and
the cross-sentence state), the `MORFOLOGIK_RULE_*`/`FR_SPELLING_RULE`
spelling rules on the exact morfologik dictionaries the server uses
(`es-ES`, `ca-ES`, `fr`, `nl_NL`, `en_US`, `pt-BR`, `ru_RU`, `uk_UA`; the
dictionaries were dumped from the LT distro jars with morfologik's own
tools), the `immunize`/`ignore_spelling` disambiguation actions, and LT's
`CleanOverlappingFilter` (the server always drops overlapping matches —
longer match wins, then the later match).

`build/gap_analysis.py` aggregates which rule IDs the server fires but
nlprule does not (400 sentences per language); the remaining gap decomposes
into:

- `ar` (0.87/0.84): `ArabicTagger.additionalTags` prefix/suffix stemming is
  ported (definite article, clitics; +145 rules recovered, 1062 examples
  pass), `HUNSPELL_RULE_AR` runs on the offline-expanded hunspell dictionary
  (30.5M forms, validated 400/400 against the server's accept/reject). The
  residue is gender subrule-variant selection and `ArabicNumberPhraseFilter`
  (needs the ArabicNumbersWords number-to-words engine).
- `es` (0.92/0.90): the sentence splitter now matches LT 6.5 exactly (see the
  SRX note below), so `UPPERCASE_SENTENCE_START` fires on the same fragments.
- `ca` (0.88/0.85): the 22 rules previously dropped for parallel-token
  control flow compile now (skip gaps on `<and>`/`<or>` members are hoisted
  after the group like LT applies them, and a `min="0"` member makes the
  group optional — FALTA_ELEMENT_ENTRE_VERBS, AL_FRONT, FICAR_POSAR, TE,
  ... fire at the same offsets as the server), and
  `SuppressIfAnyRuleMatchesFilter` is ported (re-analyzes the sentence with
  each replacement applied and suppresses the match if any listed rule
  fires overlapping — QUE_INICIAL_*/MES1 match the server). Residue:
  word-internal contractions are split like LT's CatalanWordTokenizer ("del" -> "de" + "l", also al/als/dels/pel/pels/can), which makes the CONCORDANCES_DET_* agreement family fire; residue: `PRONOMS_FEBLES_SOLTS1` over-firing on article/pronoun ambiguities,
  `MUNICIPIS_VALENCIA` (external toponym data), the CONCORDANCES_DET_* gender-agreement family, `SPELLOUT_NUMBERS`
  (CatalanNumberSpellerFilter) and `ES_UNKNOWN` (FindSuggestionsEsFilter).
- `fr` (0.90/0.88): the `D_N` determiner-noun agreement family now fires
  (the antipattern-unification bug is fixed); the residue is tagger
  reading differences and the rules still dropped for parallel-token
  control flow.
- `en` (0.88/0.86, picky rules off like the server's default level): the OpenNLP chunker is ported and loaded from
  `chunker.json` (chunks like `B-NP-singular`/`I-NP`/`E-NP`/`B-VP` verified);
  the residue is speller-backed rules (`EN_CONTRACTION_SPELLING`,
  `EN_SPLIT_WORDS_HYPHEN`) and `MORFOLOGIK_RULE_EN_US` over-firing.
- `ru` (0.93/0.92): mostly tagger differences on the `giloj_gilichnij`
  stemmer-like pairs and `MORFOLOGIK_RULE_RU_RU` suggestion-order details.
- `es`/`pt` (0.90/0.87 for pt after picky off): small; much of it is the same error caught by a variant rule
  (LT fires `HOLA_COMO_ESTAS` where nlprule fires `OLA_HOLA`).
- `nl` (0.83/0.79): the 66k-line SimpleReplaceRule table is now a
  dictionary-backed built-in with the server's `NL_SIMPLE_REPLACE_*`
  sub-rule ids (and Dutch's priority-1 for that family); Dutch
  mid-word apostrophes stay joined like `DutchWordTokenizer` ("zo'n"
  is one token). Residue: the single IETS_KLEINS/GEURIGS_GURIGS
  same-span tie (LT's insertion order there differs from the
  reverse-grammar order that matches fr/de/ca/en/es) and tagger
  reading differences.
- `de`'s speller: the server does not run it either (its `GermanSpellerRule`
  needs the ngram language model; without it "Glük"/"Fehller"/"nromale"
  are not flagged), so disabling it on our side is parity, not a gap.
  `pl`'s stemmer-based rules and the other Java-only rule classes below.

Language-specific notes:
- `ja` uses lindera with the ipadic dictionary (the same dictionary data LT uses
  via Sen/Gosen); enable the `ja` cargo feature
- `zh` uses jieba segmentation (`zh` feature) loaded with HanLP's own
  dictionaries (the mini CoreNatureDictionary + CustomDictionary, recovered
  from the double-array tries inside `hanlp.jar` — see
  `nlprule/configs/zh/hanlp_dict.txt`), so segmentation matches LT's HanLP
  setup closely (81.6% of examples pass; remaining gaps are HanLP's n-gram
  disambiguation and unknown-word heuristics)
- SimpleReplaceRule data tables (`replace*.txt`) are converted to XML rules
  automatically; tables larger than 10k lines are skipped (nl's 66k-line table
  does not fit the per-rule model)
- `sr` rules come from LT master (ekavian variant) plus its replace tables
- `da`/`km`/`crh`/`eo`/`fa` have incomplete tagger data in LT itself
- Java `RuleFilter` classes ported to runtime filters
  (`nlprule/src/rule/filter_java.rs`, data in `filter_data.rs`): the whole date
  family (DateCheck/FutureDate/NewYear/YMD/DMY/RecentYear/DateRange/... in 14
  languages), MultitokenSpeller (+ per-language word lists),
  *SuppressMisspelledSuggestions, FindSuggestions (en/fr/es/ca, with
  morfologik's frequency-ranked, diacritics-insensitive suggestion order),
  AdvancedSynthesizer, PartialPosTag (ru/ga/en), AddCommas, OrdinalSuffix,
  CompoundCheck, nl CompoundFilter, INN, DecadeSpelling, UppercaseNounReading,
  ConvertToSentenceCase, ConfusionCheck (es/pt), DiacriticsCheck (ca),
  RomanNumeral, RegularIrregularParticiple, ValidWord,
  RemoveUnknownCompounds, WhitespaceCheck, SuppressIfAnyRuleMatches (the
  re-analyze-with-replacement suppression, run in `Rules::suggest`), plus the
  English `+DT`/`+INDT`
  determiner synthesis of `EnglishSynthesizer`
- Sentence splitting matches LT 6.5's SRX semantics: LT's Java engine
  (net.loomchild.segment) only honors a `break="no"` exception whose
  `beforebreak` match *ends* exactly at the break candidate, while the Rust
  `srx` crate anchors on capture group 1. All `data2/*/segment.srx` copies
  are preprocessed accordingly: inner capture groups in `beforebreak`/
  `afterbreak` are rewritten to non-capturing (so group 1 is the crate's
  wrapper at the right offset) and the malformed Spanish abbreviation rule
  (`\b([Ee]d(it)?|[Nn]o|n|...)|[V\.]gr\.[\s\u00A0]`, whose first top-level
  branch is inert in LT but masked word starts in the crate) is replaced by
  its LT-effective form `[V\.]gr\.[\s\u00A0]`. Verified against the server:
  `Cosas. palabra` and `No. vino ayer.` split, `p. ej. esto funciona.`,
  `Sr.`/`núm.`/`Ed.` stay joined.
- Also ported: ca's pronoun/verb-morphology filters (AdjustPronouns,
  AdjustVerbSuggestions, AnarA, DonarTemps, Oblidarse, PortarGerundi,
  PortarTemps, PronomsFeblesHelper with the full weak-pronoun transformation
  tables), the Catalan synthesizer on its valencia dictionary with the
  regional verb-variant fallback and PostagComparator,
  `Catalan.adaptSuggestion`, ar MasdarToVerb/VerbToMafoulMutlaq/
  AdjectiveToExclamation/ArabicDateCheck (with ArabicTagManager flag
  arithmetic), en AdverbFilter, the disambiguation `addchunk` action (GV /
  PTime chunks for ca+es), and `IsEnglishWordFilter` (approximated with a
  frequency list of the 20k most common English words)
- Still unported: ar ArabicNumberPhraseFilter (needs ArabicNumbersWords) and
  `HUNSPELL_RULE_AR` (hunspell affix expansion of `ar.dic`), de's
  ca CatalanNumberSpellerFilter (needs the Catalan number speller) and
  ca's `FindSuggestionsEsFilter` variant,
  pt BrazilianToponymFilter (LT `<regexp>` rules are a separate rule type),
  WordWithDeterminer's `suggestionHasNoErrors` re-validation, and rules that
  are pure Java in LT with no XML (pl stemmer rules, the remaining
  language-specific speller subclasses like en's hyphen splitting and
  pt's dialect rule)

### Performance vs the LanguageTool server

`build/bench_server.py` (300 example sentences per language, single thread,
same machine; LT 6.5 via its local HTTP server at standard level — HTTP + JVM
overhead included, as a real client sees it — nlprule in-process):

nlprule loads its binaries in 0.6-14 s per language and checks every language
at sub-10 ms p95 latency; the LT server needs 0.5-2.7 s per sentence on
fr/pt/uk/ru even at the standard (non-picky) level. (*`es` p50 is 1 ms but
the mean is 16.6 ms: sentences that hit the FindSuggestions full-scan fallback
over the 3.4M-form speller dominate; `pt`'s 3.3 GB RSS and 14 s load come
from its large disambiguation data.) nlprule fires more matches than the
server because it applies rules that LT disables by default (`default="off"`).
The LT JVM RSS is cumulative: the single server process keeps every language
loaded.

With the original LT 5.2-based build directories, English passes 4192/4226 (99.2%) of its
example tests and German 3799/3903 (97.3%).
